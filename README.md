# FileEncryptionUsingFibonacciSeries
Done as a project for CSE3502 Information Security Analysis and Audit course with two other team members. This project uses Fibonacci series to encrypt the contents of the file and uses the same to decrypt the contents of the file. This provides security to the content of the file so that once encrypted the original content cannot be read by hackers as the content will be transformed into cipher text.
